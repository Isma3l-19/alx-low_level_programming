    Calculate the perimeter of the island described in the grid.
    Args:
         grid: A list of lists of integers where
        0 represents water and 1 represents land.

    Returns:
            The perimeter of the island.

    Constraints:
            Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
            Grid is rectangular, with a width and height not exceeding 100.
            Grid is completely surrounded by water,
            and there is one island (or nothing).
            The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't
            connected to the water around the island).
